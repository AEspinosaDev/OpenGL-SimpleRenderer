   <h2 align="center">CHARACTERISTICS<br> 
    </br></h2>
    
  - This project implements the basic forward rendering.  
    
  - Lenguages im using here: C,C++ and GLSL for the shading part.
  
 - There are a lot of shaders implemented, each one of them focusing on one specific part of the classic rendering techniques. They go from the simplest tasks to the more complex ones.
  
 - Most of the practical concepts are encapsulated in very simple classes. 
  
 - It supports lightning and basic types of textures. You can import your own meshes. On a close future shadows will be added in a new shader.
  
 - I use GLUT for the context and ASSIMP for importing meshes.
  
 - I believe it is a good example for people who are introducing in the graphics world.
  
  
  3D MODELS AND TEXTURES ARE ALL MADE BY ME. ANY USAGE SHOULD BE ACCREDITED.

   <h2 align="center">CONTROLS<br> 
    </br></h2>
    
 - You can move freely by using the mouse and WASD.
  
 - R = Reset position
  
 - O = Turn on/off flashlight
  
 - 2 = Decrease light intensity

  
 - 8 = Increase light intensity
  
 - 4 = Move light left
  
 - 6 = Move light right
